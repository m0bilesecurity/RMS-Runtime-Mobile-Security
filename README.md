**Runtime Mobile Security (RMS)**, powered by [FRIDA](https://github.com/frida/frida), is a powerful web interface that helps you to manipulate <b>Android and iOS Mobile Apps</b> at Runtime. 

You can easily dump all the loaded classes and relative methods, hook everything on the fly, trace methods args and return value, load custom scripts and many other useful stuff.

# General Info
Runtime Mobile Security (RMS) supports <b>Android</b> and <b>iOS</b> devices.

It has been tested on MacOS and with the following devices:
* AVD emulator
* Genymotion emulator 
* Amazon Fire Stick 4K
* iPhone 7

It should also work well on Windows and Linux but some minor adjustments may be needed.

Do not connect more than one device at the same time. RMS is not so smart at the moment ðŸ˜‰

<b>NOTE:</b> Socket are not working on Safari, please use Chrome instead.

# Prerequisites

**FRIDA server up and running on the target device**

Refer to the official FRIDA guide for the installation: 
* [Android](https://frida.re/docs/android/)
* [iOS](https://frida.re/docs/ios/)

Some cool projects that can help to **auto** install, update and run frida are:
* [MagiskFrida - Android](https://github.com/ViRb3/magisk-frida)
* [FridaLoader - Android](https://github.com/dineshshetty/FridaLoader)

# Known issues
* Sometime RMS fails to load complex methods. Use a filter when this happens or feel free to improve the algo (default.js).
* Code is not optimized

# Improvements
* Frida Gadget is currently NOT supported
* Feel free to send me your best JS sript via a Pull request. I'll be happy to bundle all the best as default scripts in the next RMS release.
e.g.
	* root detection bypass
	* ssl pinning bypass
	* reflection detection
	* etc...


# Installation

1. **(optional)** Create a python virtual environment
2. ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
3. ```python3 mobilesecurity.py```
4. Open your browser at ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/```


# Usage

## 1. Run your favorite app by simply inserting its package name ##
**NOTE** RMS attachs a persistence process called **com.android.systemui** on Android and **SpringBoard** on iOS devices to get the list of all the classes that are already loaded in memory before the launch of the target app. If you have an issue with it, try to find a different package that works well on your device. 
You can set another default package via the Config Tab or by simply editing the config.json file.

## 3. Hook on the fly Classes/Methods and trace their args and return values  ##

Go back to the dump page in order to have an overview of all the **hooked methods that have been executed by the app** âœ…

## 4. Search instances of a specific class on the Heap and call its methods ##

## 5. Select a Class and generate on the fly an Hook template for all its methods  ##

## 6. Easily detect new classes that have been loaded in memory   ##

## 7. Inject your favorite FRIDA CUSTOM SCRIPTS on the fly   ##

Just add your .js files inside the custom_script folder and they will be automatically loaded by the web interface ready to be executed.

## 8. API Monitor - Android Only ##

via the API Monitor TAB you can easily monitor tons of Android APIs organized in 19 different Categories. Support can be easily extended by adding more classes/methods to the **api_monitor.json** file.

You can also monitor native functions: libc.so - open, close, read, write, unlink, remove

## 9. FRIDA Script to load Stetho by Facebook [BONUS]  ##

Inject the FRIDA script to load the amazing [Stetho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/).

Stetho is a sophisticated debug bridge for Android applications. When enabled, developers have access to the Chrome Developer Tools feature natively part of the Chrome desktop browser. Developers can also choose to enable the optional dumpapp tool which offers a powerful command-line interface to application internals.

## 10. File Manager [BETA]  ##

A simple File Manager has been implemented to help you exploring app's private folders and files. **This feature is still in BETA.**

[frida-fs](https://github.com/nowsecure/frida-fs) has been implemented to enable files download directly from the browser (File Manager TAB).

In order to enable the download button, follow the steps below:
1. Open the file called "**mobilesecurity.py**" and set the **BETA** variable to **True**
2. Compile the "**RMS_Core.js**" agent via frida-compile! Just run the command ```npm install``` directly from the **agent** folder. A file called "**_RMS_Core_BETA.js**" will be generated.
3. Run RMS!

### DEMO apps:

[RootBeer Sample](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scottyab.rootbeer.sample) is the DEMO app used to show how RMS works.
[RootBeer](https://github.com/scottyab/rootbeer) is an **amazing root detection library**. I decided to use the Sample app as DEMO just to show that, as every client-side only check, its root detection logic can be easily bypassed if not combined with a server-side validation.
