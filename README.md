**Runtime Mobile Security (RMS)**, powered by [FRIDA](https://github.com/frida/frida), is a powerful web interface that helps you to manipulate <b>Android and iOS Apps</b> at Runtime. 

With RMS you can easily dump all loaded classes and relative methods, hook everything on the fly, trace methods args and return value, load custom scripts and many other useful stuff.

# Prerequisites
1. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer
2. [FRIDA's CLI tools](https://frida.re/docs/installation/) installed on your computer
2. **FRIDA server up and running** on the target device
    * [Android - Official Tutorial](https://frida.re/docs/android/)
    * [iOS - Official Tutorial](https://frida.re/docs/ios/)

### Quick smoke-test

As suggested by the official FRIDA doc, please perform a **quick smoke-test** to make sure **FRIDA is working properly on your test device**.

By running the ```frida-ps -U``` command from your desktop, you should receive the list of the processes running on your connected mobile device.

```
Android                    | iOS
  PID NAME                 |  PID NAME
 1590 com.facebook.katana  |  488 Clock
 3282 com.twitter.android  |  116 Facebook
 â€¦                            â€¦
```
### Tips
Some cool projects that can help you to **auto** install, update and run FRIDA on Android devices are:
* [MagiskFrida - Android](https://github.com/ViRb3/magisk-frida)
* [FridaLoader - Android](https://github.com/dineshshetty/FridaLoader)

They are not needed on iOS devices, since FRIDA starts just after the boot of the device (jailbreak mode).

# Installation
1. Open the terminal and run the following command to install the npm package   
    * ```npm install -g rms-runtime-mobile-security``` 
2. Make sure frida-server is up and running on the target device. 
    * Instructions are here: [prerequisites](https://github.com/m0bilesecurity/RMS-Runtime-Mobile-Security#prerequisites) / [quick smoke-test](https://github.com/m0bilesecurity/RMS-Runtime-Mobile-Security#quick-smoke-test)
3. Launch RMS via the following command 
    * ```rms``` (or ```RMS-Runtime-Mobile-Security```)
4. Open your browser at ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/```
5. Start enjoying RMS ðŸ“±ðŸ”¥ 

## Notes and possibile issues
1. In case of issues with your favorite Browser (e.g. logs not printed in the web console), please use <b>Google Chrome</b> (fully supported)
2. If <b>RMS is not able to detect your device</b>, please perform the following checks:
    * double check if frida-server is up and running on the target device. Instructions are here: [prerequisites](https://github.com/m0bilesecurity/RMS-Runtime-Mobile-Security#prerequisites)
    / [quick smoke-test](https://github.com/m0bilesecurity/RMS-Runtime-Mobile-Security#quick-smoke-test)
    * RMS must be started **after** frida-server
    * make sure that **only 1 device** is connected to your computer. RMS is currently not able to detect multiple devices
    * kill RMS and start it again 
# Development mode
Follow the steps below if you want to develop new features for RMS ðŸ˜‰
1. ```git clone https://github.com/m0bilesecurity/RMS-Runtime-Mobile-Security.git```
2. ```cd RMS-Runtime-Mobile-Security```
3. ```npm install -g .``` (or ```npm install``` for a local installation)
4. Launch RMS via the ```rms``` command (or via ```node app.js``` if the package has been installed locally)

**NOTE:** If you add new features to the agent (/agent/RMS_core.js), please remember to recompile the code by running ```npm install -g .``` or directly via the frida-compile command (```frida-compile agent/RMS_core.js -o agent/compiled_RMS_core.js```)

# General Info
Runtime Mobile Security (RMS) supports <b>Android</b> and <b>iOS</b> devices.

It has been tested on MacOS and with the following devices:
* AVD emulator
* Genymotion emulator 
* Amazon Fire Stick 4K
* iPhone 7
* Chrome (Web Interface)

It should also work well on Windows and Linux but some minor adjustments may be needed.

# Known issues and improvements
* Sometime RMS fails to load complex methods. Use a filter when this happens or feel free to improve the algo (agent/RMS_core.js)
* Socket are not working on Safari, <b>please use Chrome</b> instead
*  RMS is not able to recognize multiple devices. Please do not connect more than one device at the same time
* Code is not optimized
* Feel free to send me your best JS script via a Pull Request. I'll be happy to bundle all the best as default scripts in the next RMS release (e.g. root detection bypass, ssl pinning, etc)


# Usage

## 1. Run your favorite app by simply inserting its package name ##
**NOTE** RMS attachs a persistence process called **com.android.systemui** on Android and **SpringBoard** on iOS devices to get the list of all the classes that are already loaded in memory before the launch of the target app. If you have an issue with them, try to find a different default package that works well on your device. 
You can set another default package via the Config Tab or by simply editing the **/config/config.json** file.

## 2. Check which Classes and Methods have been loaded in memory  ##
![DEMO_2_Android](/DEMO/Android/DEMO_2_Dump.gif)

![DEMO_2_iOS](/DEMO/iOS/DEMO_2_Dump.gif)

## 3. Hook on the fly Classes/Methods and trace their args and return values  ##
![DEMO_3_a](/DEMO/Android/DEMO_3_Massive_Hook.gif)

Go back to the dump page in order to have an overview of all the **hooked methods that have been executed by the app** âœ…

## 4. Search instances of a specific class on the Heap and call its methods ##

![DEMO_4_iOS](/DEMO/iOS/DEMO_4_Heap_Search.gif)

## 5. Select a Class and generate on the fly an Hook template for all its methods  ##

## 6. Easily detect new classes that have been loaded in memory   ##
![DEMO_6](/DEMO/Android/DEMO_6_Diff_Classes.gif)

## 7. Inject your favorite FRIDA CUSTOM SCRIPTS on the fly   ##

Just add your .js files inside the **custom_script folder** and they will be automatically loaded by the web interface ready to be executed.

## 8. API Monitor - Android Only ##

via the API Monitor TAB you can easily monitor tons of Android APIs organized in 20 different Categories. Support can be easily extended by adding more classes/methods to the **/config/api_monitor.json** file.

![DEMO_10](/DEMO/Android/DEMO_10_API_Monitor.png)

You can also monitor native functions: libc.so - open, close, read, write, unlink, remove

## 9. FRIDA Script to load Stetho by Facebook [BONUS]  ##

Inject the FRIDA script to load the amazing [Stetho](http://facebook.github.io/stetho/).

Stetho is a sophisticated debug bridge for Android applications. When enabled, developers have access to the Chrome Developer Tools feature natively part of the Chrome desktop browser. Developers can also choose to enable the optional dumpapp tool which offers a powerful command-line interface to application internals.

## 10. File Manager [BETA]  ##

A simple File Manager has been implemented to help you exploring app's private folders and files. **This feature is still in BETA.**

**improvement:** [frida-fs](https://github.com/nowsecure/frida-fs) needs to be implemented to enable files download directly from the browser (File Manager TAB).

### DEMO apps:

* [RootBeer Sample](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scottyab.rootbeer.sample) is the DEMO app used to show how RMS works.
[RootBeer](https://github.com/scottyab/rootbeer) is an **amazing root detection library**. I decided to use the Sample app as DEMO just to show that, as every client-side only check, its root detection logic can be easily bypassed if not combined with a server-side validation.
